# Payment Configuration and Callback Guide

> Updated: 2026-04-04

You only need two outcomes:

1. Customers can start payment successfully
2. Orders are marked as paid automatically after payment

## 1. What You Need Before Starting

Make sure your payment callback endpoint is publicly reachable.  
Both deployment styles are supported:

1. Same-origin reverse proxy (common)
2. Separate frontend/backend domains

Common URL examples:

- Same-origin reverse proxy
  - Payment notification URL (callback): `https://shop.example.com/api/v1/payments/callback`
  - Customer return page after payment: `https://shop.example.com/pay`
- Separate frontend/backend domains
  - Payment notification URL (callback): `https://api.example.com/api/v1/payments/callback`
  - Customer return page after payment: `https://shop.example.com/pay`

Note: The rest of this guide uses the separate-domain example. If you use same-origin reverse proxy, replace `api.example.com` with your site domain.

## 2. Where to Configure in Admin

Go to:

- `Admin → Payment Management → Payment Channels → Create`

For each channel, do these 3 things:

1. Fill merchant credentials (keys/IDs from the payment provider)
2. Fill callback URL (so the provider can notify your server)
3. Enable the channel and set display order

## 3. What to Fill for Each Payment Provider

## 3.9 Fee Configuration

Each payment channel can have its own fee settings for calculating the actual amount received:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Fee Rate (`fee_rate`) | Percentage fee, e.g., `2.00` means 2% |
| Fixed Fee (`fixed_fee`) | Fixed amount deducted per transaction |

Fees are used only for admin statistics and profit calculation. They do **not** increase the amount the customer pays.

---

## 3.10 Interaction Modes

When creating a payment channel, you must select an interaction mode that determines the customer's payment experience:

| Mode | Identifier | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| QR Code | `qr` | Generates a payment QR code for the customer to scan (suitable for WeChat Pay / Alipay, etc.) |
| Redirect | `redirect` | Redirects to the payment platform page to complete payment (suitable for PayPal / Stripe, etc.) |

> The same payment type can have multiple channels using different interaction modes. For example, Alipay can be configured with both QR code and redirect modes simultaneously.

## 4. Callback & Webhook (Easy Reference)

### 4.1 Shared Callback URL (use the same URL)

Applies to:

- Alipay
- WeChat Pay
- EPay
- TokenPay
- BEpusdt
- OKPay

Use:

- `POST https://api.example.com/api/v1/payments/callback`

### 4.2 PayPal (separate webhook URL)

Use:

- `POST https://api.example.com/api/v1/payments/webhook/paypal?channel_id=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID`

Note:

- `channel_id` is required in current implementation.

### 4.3 Stripe (separate webhook URL)

Use:

- `POST https://api.example.com/api/v1/payments/webhook/stripe?channel_id=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID`

Note:

- `channel_id` is strongly recommended if you have multiple Stripe channels.

## 5. Custom Callback Routes (Optional)

Since this project is open source, the default callback paths (e.g., `/api/v1/payments/callback`) are publicly known, which poses a risk of malicious callback simulation or brute-force attacks. You can customize callback route paths in the admin panel to hide the defaults and improve security.

### 5.1 How to Configure

Go to:

- `Admin → Settings → Callback Routes`

You can customize these 4 callback paths:

| Callback Type | Default Path | Description |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Payment Callback | `/api/v1/payments/callback` | Shared by Alipay/WeChat/EPay/TokenPay/BEpusdt/OKPay |
| PayPal Webhook | `/api/v1/payments/webhook/paypal` | PayPal only |
| Stripe Webhook | `/api/v1/payments/webhook/stripe` | Stripe only |
| Upstream Callback | `/api/v1/upstream/callback` | Upstream supplier callback |

Leave empty to keep using the default path.

### 5.2 Rules

- Custom paths must start with `/api/`, e.g., `/api/my-secret-path/pay-notify`
- All 4 paths must be unique (no duplicates)
- Must not conflict with existing system routes (e.g., `/api/v1/admin/...`, `/api/v1/public/...`)

### 5.3 After Configuration

::: warning Important
After customizing callback routes, you **must** update the notification URL (`notify_url` / `callback_url`) in each payment channel configuration to match the new path.

For example, if you set the payment callback route to `/api/my-secret/pay-notify`:

- Before: `https://api.example.com/api/v1/payments/callback`
- After: `https://api.example.com/api/my-secret/pay-notify`

Otherwise, payment provider callbacks will not reach your server.
:::

### 5.4 How It Works

- Once a custom route is configured, the corresponding default path automatically returns 404 and becomes undetectable
- Callback types without custom paths continue using defaults — they are independent
- Changes take effect within approximately 5 minutes (or immediately on the current instance)

## 6. 5-Minute Pre-Launch Checklist

Test in this order:

1. Place an order and confirm payment page/QR opens correctly
2. Complete payment and confirm order status becomes paid automatically
3. Confirm customer is redirected to `https://shop.example.com/pay`
4. Confirm payment record appears in admin for that order

## 7. Common Problems

### Q1: Payment succeeded for user, but order is still unpaid in admin

Check first:

- Callback URL typo (domain/path) — if you configured custom callback routes, make sure each channel's `notify_url` has been updated accordingly
- API domain not publicly reachable
- Failed callback logs in payment provider console

### Q2: User does not return to your payment page

Check first:

- `return_url` / `success_url` / `cancel_url` / `redirect_url` are all set to `/pay`

### Q3: Multiple channels under one provider cause mixed callbacks

Fix:

- Always include `channel_id` in PayPal and Stripe webhook URLs
- Keep only channels you actively use enabled
