## [v0.0.5-beta] - 2026-02-25

### Update Details:
- Added a gift card system: admin now supports gift card generation, status management, filtering, batch status updates, and export; user center now includes a gift card redeem page (with motion effects), supports scene-based captcha switch (image captcha/Turnstile), and credits redeemed amount to wallet balance automatically.
- Updated gift card currency strategy: gift card generation in admin now automatically inherits the site-wide currency and removes manual currency input, preventing currency configuration mismatch.

- Added Telegram login: first-time Telegram login without an existing account binding now auto-creates an account and signs in directly.
